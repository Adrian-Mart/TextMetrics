== Gameplay ==

Using a top-down perspective (akin to Gauntlet), the player controls either Ben or Andy, a pair of agents charged with stopping mad scientist Mr. X (Mr.K in the Sega Mega Drive version) from taking over the world, as they make their way through several timed levels, planting bombs and destroying cyborg enemies using guns (the "machine gun" and the "cannon" can be swapped back and forth) and smart bombs (which wipe out all enemies on screen). The goal of each stage is to plant all of the bombs and escape before their collective timer goes off.


== Reception ==

In Japan, Game Machine listed Crack Down on their May 15, 1989 issue as being the third most popular arcade game during the previous two weeks. Console XS gave a review score of 82%, commending its detailed graphics, "addictive" gameplay, and the two player mode. They concluded saying it is worth playing. MegaTech gave the Genesis version a review score of 65%. They praised the two player mode, but criticized the game's lack of challenge.
