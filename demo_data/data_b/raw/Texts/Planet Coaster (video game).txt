Planet Coaster 2 is a construction and management simulation video game developed and published by Frontier Developments. It is a sequel to Planet Coaster (2016). The game was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on 6 November 2024.


== Plot ==
The player character joins Coaster Coast, a company building amusement parks, led by Oswald B. Thompson along with his engineers, brothers Eugene and Brad Newton, specializing in rollercoasters and water parks, respectively. The company takes on multiple failing amusement parks, while they are opposed by Nana Betty, who disguises herself as a charitable old businesswoman, and Kenta Suzuki, a former associate of Oswald‘s who blames the latter for destroying his family‘s amusement park. After restoring all parks, Betty‘s evil intentions are revealed and she has to retreat, while Kenta switches sides when it is discovered that it was actually Betty who destroyed his family business. 


== Gameplay ==
As a sequel to 2016's Planet Coaster, Planet Coaster 2 expands upon its predecessor with improved building tools, water park building and management, and event sequencing gameplay. Like its predecessor, the game features career, sandbox, and challenge mode. Cross-platform cooperative gameplay has been added, with players able to visit other parks online, or build a new one together with save sharing.
The game features many returning systems from Planet Coaster, which have been re-built using feedback from the first game. This includes the pathing system, which has been changed from a piece-by-piece building system to a draw system. New utilities for building scenery pieces have also been added, including object scaling and mirroring/twinning, and the ability to add scenery pieces directly to rides and roller coasters. Update 2 was launched on 12 February 2025, which introduced customizable video billboards and synchronized ride launches.


== Development and release ==
Prior to Planet Coaster 2, Frontier Developments was working on the F1 Manager series, and Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin, but both titles underperformed, contributing to layoffs in an organizational review. This also changed the company's strategy from diversifying the game portfolio to refocusing on the management simulation genre, which had previously led them success.
The game's title was leaked in June 2024, when an unofficial site tracking games on the Epic Games Store revealed an upcoming title by Frontier Developments titled Planet Coaster 2. The game was formally revealed on 11 July 2024 with its first official trailer, and had a gameplay reveal on 31 July 2024 in a Frontier Unlocked livestream. It released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on 6 November 2024.
