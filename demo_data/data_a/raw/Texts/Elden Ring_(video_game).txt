Elden Ring Nightreign is an upcoming 2025 action role-playing game developed and published by FromSoftware. A cooperative spinoff of Elden Ring, it was revealed at The Game Awards 2024, and is scheduled to be released for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally.


== Gameplay ==
The game is set in a procedurally generated version of Limgrave, now named Limveld, the first open-world area of Elden Ring. While the game has a single-player mode, it is intended to be played cooperatively by teams of three players who collaborate over three in-game days to prepare for the final boss. Similar to battle royale games,  Nightreign features a shrinking gameplay area which resets after players defeat the minor boss at the end of each in-game day.


== Development ==
Elden Ring Nightreign is in development by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Bandai Namco Entertainment registered the trademark for "Nightreign" on October 24, 2024, with it being revealed at The Game Awards 2024 in December. It is scheduled to be released on May 30, 2025. The first network test took place in February 2025 on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, with players able to register from January 10 to 20.
Nightreign is being directed by Junya Ishizaki, who worked as a designer on Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Dark Souls III, and Elden Ring. Fantasy author George R. R. Martin, who wrote the backstory of Elden Ring, is not involved with Nightreign.
