EyeToy: Play is a minigame compilation video game developed by London Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It was the first game to make use of the PlayStation 2's video camera accessory, EyeToy. The game was initially packaged with the EyeToy when the accessory was first released.


== Gameplay ==
EyeToy: Play features twelve mini-games to choose from. This game, and all other EyeToy titles, are played by moving one's body. The motion is detected by the USB camera. The software recognizes pixel changes in the video image and compares the proximity of the change to other game objects to play the game. Users who get a high score get to take a photo to tease other players.

=== Critical reception ===

The game received "generally favorable" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.  In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, one six, one seven, and one six, for a total of 28 out of 40. Tim Tracy of GameSpot described it as a "solid choice" for those "who have little or no interest in video games". Douglass Perry of IGN described all the minigames as "simple, instantly graspable, and fun for a single player", although highlighted that "none of [them] are deep in any way." Kristan Reed for Eurogamer felt EyeToy: Play was "tremendous fun for a quick mess around if you've got a few mates around" but playing alone "feels a bit pointless."
