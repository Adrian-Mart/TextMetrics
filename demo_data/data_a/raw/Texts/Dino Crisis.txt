=== Future ===
For several decades fans have been asking for a new installment in the Dino Crisis series. In 2014, there was circulating news that Capcom had begun development on Dino Crisis 4 with the intention of announcing the sequel at the Tokyo Game Show of that year. Tao Weishi, the producer of Monster Hunter Online, was interested in working with Capcom on a revival of the Dino Crisis series. Bocanegra stated: "It would certainly be nice to get a Dino Crisis revival. And Capcom could potentially start by remastering the original game, which would fall in line nicely with their current strategy when it comes to remasters". Shinji Mikami has also stated that he has long held ideas for a new game in the series.
In March 2017, Capcom's Masachika Kawata said he was not aware of any internal plans to revive the series despite it being a good prospect for remasters or remakes. In December, the official Twitter account for Capcom's lead development team responded to a fan asking if a new Dino Crisis title would release soon, to which they replied: "If a lot of people wish".
Both the original Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2 are available to play on GOG.com as part of GOG's ongoing Preservation Program. Both of the games was available to purchase on January 29, 2025.
